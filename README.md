* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As a financial advisor, you can keep track of your clients
  * As a financial advisor, you can view your appointments and schedule for the day
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing client information.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Financial Advisor Planner` (`FAP` for short) because it allows financial advisors to plan their schedule and appointments with clients
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Financial Advisor Planner Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
